It has been a long time since I posted something, too long for my taste, I took a vacation of sort.

I have been really busy with personal life and lot of projects at work which left little in terms of writing time but finally things should be settling now and I am able to dedicate some time to my favorite activity, **writing**.

I am hard at work writing new articles and putting together some code fore new functions I will release soon.

So stay tuned for more content and in the meantime leave a comment to let me know you're there or if there any specific topic you would like to see featured in the blog or function, script or code snippet you're looking for!
